## Narrative 2024-08-16

I apparently have 0% APR through the end of the year on my discover card. I did not know that. Confirm that and then develop a strategy around having five grand available interest free for the rest of the year.

I have a single priority. And that is to generate revenue.

I have a clunky APK installed on my phone. Motorhead Meditation.

Work on only Motorhead meditation until it starts generating revenue or is a clear failure.

I don't need the bus. 

I have an office. With power, air conditioning, a chair and desk, a cold shower, and internet. Also someplace to park the van.

## Goals 2024-08-16

Done. \- Flush brake fluid.

Replace thermostat.

Finish Motorhead Meditation app.

## Strategy 2024-08-16

I have a clunky app I need to work on until it is pretty enough to put out there.

Build the website to sell the app.

Create the weblog for Motorhead Meditation.

Pay off my phone and Port my primary number over to visible. I never use Google fi. If I need a T-Mobile link, think it a T-Mobile account.

Maybe create a en.elonara.com subdomain and redirect elonara.com to it. Then es.elonara.com and german and french.  Then learn how to use the useragent to decide what subdomains to redirect to based on the language.

## Updated goals

Redirect elonara.com to en.elonara.com and clean up public\_html.

## Updated strategy

Build the app myself.

Done. \- Rent an office.

Apparently I can make an iPhone app in Android studio. Do that.

Start over with version control this time.

I want a top bar with a navigation menu that points to the sound description file page. Each one of the cards in the sound file description file link back to the appropriate play button.

An article for the other weblog. If you quit your job and sold all your stock so you could start your own business and bought a sprinter conversion to live in while you got your business off the ground you're homeless and you need help.

If I do find a place to live, it pays for itself or makes a profit. The only reasonable exception to this is my boat. My boat is not going to be a business. Even though it will be owned by an LLC as a tax haven somehow.

Our initial business model is to give away the basic app as a beta. Then we have the option of selling the app through the app stores or offering the app with a subscription service or continuing to give away the app and offering upgrades.

If any of that works we can start adding a physical product. I'm thinking rings with a phone app. Maybe we can think about getting into the smartwatch Marketplace I kind of doubt it. I would prefer to be acquired by then.

 When I was a young house painter the stress energized us accelerated us. But as a tech support person was the exact opposite. The stress was debilitating and exhausting. It gave me a short fuse and impatience. It made me impatient and
